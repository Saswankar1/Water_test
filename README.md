# Water_test

This repository contains a machine learning model used for water potability. The model is deployed using Render, a cloud application platform. The repository includes the trained model, the main application script, and the dependencies required to run the model.

Full Code: [Water Potability Repo](https://github.com/Saswankar1/Water-Potability)

## Files in the Repository

- **model.pkl**: The trained machine learning model saved as a pickle file.
- **main.py**: The main application script that loads the model and handles predictions.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python dependencies required to run the application.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project locally or on a server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Water_test.git
   cd Water_test
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, it will load the `model.pkl` file and use it to make predictions. The specific prediction logic and input/output formats will depend on the implementation in `main.py`.

## Deployment on Render

To deploy this application on Render, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new Web Service** on Render.
2. **Connect your GitHub repository** containing this code.
3. **Set the build command** (if needed):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set the start command**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Deploy the service**. Render will automatically detect the necessary files and start the application.
